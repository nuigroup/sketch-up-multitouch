-The extension upon completion will allow Multitouch interactions into the SketchUp UI. Users having access to TUIO based multitouch hardware
would be able to interact/ Draw stuff into Google SketchUp using gestures.

There'll be two main tasks to accomplish
- Camera Movements (Panning/Orbit/Zoom) using Multitouch two finger gesture
- Drawing using gestures(We're figuring out how it'll work) since most Google SketchUp interactions are single mouse touch way.

Current Status: The TUIO data is received within the SketchUp User interface.
Bugs: The Stack size of Console makes GoogleSU crash on receiving the TUIO messages, so we'll use an builtin window using a DLL that displays and logs
the receives messages

************************
CURRENT STATUS            //Tasks Completed
************************
-DLL loading within Sketchup
-TUIO connection done
-TUIO logging done
-UI, IconSet loading from toolbar
************************
REAMINING TASK               //To be done by END of August, - priority 1: Currently trying Ruby API camera methods, priority 2: try the Mouse emulation
************************
- Gestures mapping(Pan, Zoom, Orbit:: Line, Circle, Square::Push Pull objects) -> Hard
- Mapping each Iconset to Multitouch Methods -> Easy
